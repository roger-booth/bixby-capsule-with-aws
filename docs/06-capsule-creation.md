## Register Capsule in the Bixby Developer Center

- request a free Samsung account
- create an organization on the Bixby Dev Center

## Iterate on Capsule Development

The tasks in this section continue your capsule development by updating the boilerplate code with
your own ideas. If you are just trying to get the sample capsule running as is, you may skip this
section and move on to Testing the Capsule.

Some of the tasks you will do at this stage with your own capsule are:
- work out the rest api code that differs from the sample capsule
- create concepts and actions for your capsule's unique features
- update the training, to look for the correct responses to partiular phrases
- complete the JavaScript code for new actions
- write new dialogs to determine how Bixby speaks when these actions run
- write new views to determine how it Bixby looks when these actions return results

## Testing the Capsule

- run the Simulator to try out the NL

## Submit a Release to Marketplace

When you capsule is ready to be submitted to the marketplace, come back here for ideas about what
steps to take:
- create a private submission of the capsule
- test it on a device
- choose a marketplace category
- go through the checklist for submissions
- make a public submission when you are ready to release
